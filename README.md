This repository contains the three tasks of Level 1 I completed during my web development internship with Oasis Infobyte. Each task is described below:

## Lvel1-Task 1: Landing Page

For my first task, I created a landing page for a gaming website. The landing page was developed using HTML and CSS. It includes various sections such as the homepage, game details, about us, and contact. The layout is designed to be visually appealing.

**Description:** This task involved designing and implementing the front-end of a gaming website's landing page. The main focus was on creating an engaging user interface using HTML and CSS.

## Task 2: Portfolio / Resume Website

The second task involved developing a personal portfolio or resume website. I used HTML and CSS to create a professional-looking portfolio showcasing my skills, Interest, and Education. The website is designed to highlight my achievements and provide an overview of my capabilities.

**Description:** In this task, I designed and built a portfolio website to showcase my Education, Interests, and skills as a web developer. The website includes sections such as Home, Education, Skills, and contact.

## Task 3: Temperature Converter Website

For the third task, I created a temperature converter website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website allows users to input a temperature in one unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit or kelvin) and converts it to the other unit in real-time. It provides a simple and interactive way to perform temperature conversions.

**Description:** This task required building a dynamic temperature converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input a temperature value, choose the unit, and instantly see the converted result.
